				<h2>Ready...Set... SUMMER!</h2>
				<p>My favorite part about summer is the freedom. The freedom from the typical school rules, the freedom to choose how you want to spend your days, and the freedom to wear that princess dress, baseball cap, or whatever else you want. Oh, wait... is that not a typical summer acitivity? Well, at Kamp kayla it is. Not only do you get to dress up in fun-ky outfits every day, but you also have a lot of FUN while doing it.</p>
				<p>My past 4 years at Summer Institute have been an amazing place to watch kids grow. I've seen kids bake for the first time, learn about energetic exchange with thier personal gardens, and how the big kid buddies assume responsibility for the youngers ones as they help teach them new games or locate the perfect book in the library. So this year, I'm combining all of that into one place--and we are calling it, Kamp Kayla! </p>
				<p>Each day will be broken up into 4 major parts, and each day of the week will be based around a range of thematic activites. This will allow for a balance of physical activites, some mental acquity, individual passion projects, big group acitivites, and all the while working on forming friendships, cultivating life lessons, and walking away with a well-rounded, absolutely awesome summer camp experience.

				<p><span>Morning Minutes</span><br><br>Each morning will begin by putting our brains to work. It will be the same structure each morning, with either some guided focus on what to brainstorm about, or choose something different, it's up to you. Maybe it will be story writing, math fitness, reading your passion-pick book, personal goal setting, or anything other mental acitivty that gets us geared up and prepared for the day. Morning Minutes will be followed by working on something I call a "Passion Project" which is to contribute a little bit of time each day to something that you feel passionate about. The morning will be our time to explore what really sets your soud on fire!</p>

			<div class="flex-item" id="weekly-roundup">
				<p><span>Weekly Round-up</span><br><br>Each day of the week will have a separate focus and will be applied throughout the day, from our Morning Minutes to our afternoon group activites: Movement Monday is everything from dance and group games, sports, and yoga stretches. Yummy Tummy Tuesday will include some baking and planting our own vegetable plant. Wacky Science Wednesday will include some fun kitchen chemistry as well as some outdoor nature scavenger hunts. Tinker-time Thursday will allow for some creative exploration and innovation as kids get a chance to create and build whatever they want, whether it's arts+crafts, a cardboard project, or maybe something for thier passion project! Feed-Me Friday will be food-focused--giving back to those who need it, as well as making some treats for ourselves and a very special fun Friday treat to end the week.

				<p><span>Passion Project</span><br><br>The passion project is broken up into two parts: the kid's individual passion-pick which is their focus for thier summer project. We will have time to write, brainstorm, and create, any and all ideas that may arise. As a whole we will also pick a "Helping Hands" passion project which will be my focus, and will be a collective effort as a whole to do something kind and helpful to give back to our community. Each day we will set aside some time to work directly on the project, as well as some additional time may be spent while tinkering or in morning minutes working on something that can contribute to your passion.
